 		<h1>How-to Guide Youtube Player API</h1>
 	</div>
 	<div id="section1">
 		<p>This guide is meant to demonstrate how to use the functions of the Youtube API to embed videos into a website.</br></br>More information on how to use this API can be found at</br><h4>https://developers.google.com/youtube/</h4>There are a lot of features that I will not cover in this guide.  I will not focus on using features associated with ones own Youtube channel.  These features would allow someone to manage the analytics of their channel and view data associated with views and subscriptions. I will instead focus on the features that focus on using the player as a viewing platform within a website.  </p>

 		<div id="text2"><p>Below is an example of what the player will look and act like when using the default constructor with no alterations.  To gain the ability to embed Youtube videos into our page we first make a div tag in our html for the video.  Next we load the IFrame Player API into our script.  Last we must call the Youtube IFrame constructor to populate our IFrame element with video content.  The video below was made using the constructor with all default options intact.  In this state the video will have features and look just like it would on the Youtube page.  The only 3 pieces of information required in the constructor are the height and width of the player and the video ID of the content to be played.  The smallest size allowed for a player is a width and height of 200. </p>

 		<p><hr /></br><h2>Tweaking the Player</h2>There are a lot of ways to tweak the player using the constructor.<h4>playerVars: {} and events: {}</h4>Using these commands in the constructor will give the programmer freedom to adjust the features and behavior of the player.  The documentation does a good job of going over all the parameters but there is one parameter that could potentially change the performance of a website.  IFrame will automatically choose what kind type of video player to use based on the client software. When IFrame creates a Flash video it may behave differently than if HTML5 is used. If Flash is used the Youtube constructor will load the video and all the player's features when the page loads.  This can cause significant slowdown in a page especially if multiple videos are listed on the same page.  If you change the default setting for controls to the value 2 the video will only show a thumbnail when the page loads. All the features of the player are only loaded if the user interacts with the video.  Something nice about using the Youtube constructor is it automatically triggers the enablejsapi parameter so our script can communicate with our IFrame. If we used html to create our Youtube IFrame tag this parameter would need to be manually set to enable javascipt functionality.</p>

 	<div id="section4">
 		<div id="text4"><p>Below is an example of how a combination of options can be use to limit the features of the player. I used the following options so that the new player would act much different than the previous player.<h4>playerVars: {</br>color: 'white',</br>controls: 0,</br>rel: 0</br>}</h4>Let's say I had a site where I just wanted to embed a single video and I only wanted some of controls available to the user.  By setting controls to 0 the user can only play and pause the video by clicking on the video.  I could then use an event listener to create my own buttons to interact with the player.  Outside of the constructor if the dot operator is used along with your video variable you can trigger certain events in the player.  The documentation does a good job of explaining how to implement features like play, pause and skip to next video but for my example I used<h4>.mute() and .unMute()</h4>Now the user can play, pause, mute and unmute this video without having the access to the default Youtube controls.  I also set the parameter rel to 0 for the player below.  Normally Youtube recommends other videos after the current video finishes but setting this parameter to 0 toggles this feature off.  </p>

            <input type="button" id="mute" value="mute" />
            <input type="button" id="unmute" value="unmute" />

 		<p><hr /><h2>Playlists</h2>Instead of using a single video id we can populate our IFrame player to include a collection of videos or a playlist.<h4>listType: 'playlist',</br>list: 'PLOU2XLYxmsIKXYR_3iOWnI4h1Do_aa8dn',</br>showinfo: 1</h4>Putting these parameters into the Youtube constructor and removing the videoId variable will load a video that is part of a playlist.  The video below is an example of what a playlist looks like in the IFrame.  With HTML5 the player will add a drop down menu in the upper left side to allow the user to navigate to the other videos in the same playlist.  Flash players will behave slightly different and by default they will not display the other videos in the playlist. Setting the parameter showinfo to 1 will bring this functionality to Flash.</p>

 		<div id="text6"><p><hr /><h2>Loading New Content</h2>Once a player is constructed and populated with a video there are ways to navigate to another video using some of Youtube's features but there is not a lot of freedom.  Using javascript we can navigate much easier.  The Youtube API document goes into detail on how we can also search for things like playlists and videos from a specific Youtube user.  The search box below the third video of this page will change the content of that player with a playlist of results returned from Youtube's search engine.<h4>"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&q=" + document.getElementById('keyword').value + "&type=video"</h4>This Get request uses a query search to find Youtube videos based on a keyword.  We are sent back a JSON object which can be parsed to access the videoIDs of our search results.<h4>ids[i] = YTData.items[i].id.videoId;</h4>In a loop an array of strings is built using the video IDs parsed from the JSON object. We use this array to build a custom playlist.  With the following command the third video player can be populated with a custom playlist using the results from the search.<h4>cuePlaylist(ids);</h4>Once the new video is started the playlist drop down menu will be updated with some other results from the search.</p>
